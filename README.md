 # Tetris
 Set up your virtual environment and then do:
 ```
 pip install gymnasium[atari,accept-rom-license]
 ```
To install gymnasium along with Atari and the ROMs

See [the documentation](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/atari/tetris/) for more details.


# realtimeReader.py
Currently to call the realtime log reader do:
```
python realtimeReader.py "path of file"
```
This doesn't do anything as of current, but this will link up with the model later.
